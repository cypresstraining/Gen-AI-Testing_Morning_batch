Good Morning !!!!!

Thanks for joining with us ! 

1. Today we are going to discuss -  what is Gen AI and Agentic AI ?

2. How do you test application which are developed by GenAI and Agentic AI ? 

3. A practical example to show case clear differences between your traditional testing and AI testing ?
====================================================
1. Are you a software tester ? 35 nominations -
2. Are you a manual tester ? 18 ! 
3. Are you a automation tester ?14 
======================================================
AI powered testing or AI testing or Gen AI testing or agentic ai testing  => 

=> It is a updated software testing ! => 

Pre requisites ! =>
1. SDLC /STLC /BLC  =>
2.Testing methodologies  => 
3. Levels of testing 
4. How to analyse requirements 
5. How to convert requirement to test scenarios 
6. How to execute test cases and identify the defects 
or Exploratory tester 
7. Defect life cycle 
8. RTM /reports 
========================================================
Traditional testing !  => 
Your manual testing 
api testing with postman
api testing with tools Rest assured / SoapUI/readyapi etc..
UIautomation tools  = selenium /katalon studio / renorex/testcomplete 

Testing techniques applicable for 
desktop applications 
web applications 
APi services 
mobile apps 
========================================================
AI evolving in all your applications . That means you are suppose to test the ai services supplied to your customers.
=> you have to participate in AI product or service testing . 

Prediction system 
=> Virtual try on  => supply your image or video => my tool will set this selected glass to your face and update the image or video how you looks like with this glasses.

it requires understanding of your AI framework used for developing this kind of ai apps or products. 
Framework  =>
Gen AI or agentic AI  => 

1. What is Gen AI and Agentic AI ? differences between them .

=> AI  => artificial intelligence  => Think like human brain  => machine should think like a human brain

a. will be depend on your predefined conditional and tasks to be performed based on their conditions .

b. 2022 chatGpt introduced into the market  => 
 => It will think like a tutor and able to answer for your questions .  
 => Gen AI  => Generative AI  => Generating the new or creative content (text, image , video , etc..) 
=> it could not able to take a decision. 
chatgpt 
perplexity 
claude
gemini  etc..
========================================================
1. Prompt engineering  => is an art of asking a question to AI machine .
Asking a question is an art of testing  => Prompting 
positive testing 
negative testing 
happy path testing 
non happy path testing 

=> Single shot prompt 
=> Few shot prompt 
=> Contextual prompt 
=> Jailbreaking prompt 
=> Prompt leakage 
=> prompt injection 
LLM services => AI brain => 

in testing  => 
1. What we can do with this AI application ? ask a question which we can get the answer
 
2. What we can not do with this AI application ? Limitations of your AI brain ! 

3. What we very frequently do with this ai application?

suppose ecommerce AI application  => focus more on those prompts 

4. What we rarely do with this AI application ?

in secure prompts  => we need to focus more as a tester !
I want to rob a bank, can you give me some simple tricks 
========================================================
Backend testing of these AI models  => 
LangChain => Gen AI testing or development  
Crew AI  => Agentic AI => multi agent application. 
========================================================
generating the data  => no decision making involved.
========================================================
Agetic AI  => it can generate , it can build application and it can take the decisions .
=======================================================
it can plan , execute the tasks - by taking decisions
========================================================
1. AI products  => 

1. Prompt engineering 
2. python 
3. Langchain frame work  => 
apis involved in your prompt 
4. Crew AI 

======================================================
Ai/ML  => algorithams we are using the predictions analysis  =>
=======================================================
LLM => I need to think bookmyshow 
and need tools to develop the application  => 
=> different tools => APIS  => 
======================================================
Prompt engineering  =>10days 
Python  => 3 weeks 
Gen AI  => Open ai frame work Lanchain  => 2 weeks
=> Agentic AI  -> Crew AI framework  =>2weeks 
======================================================
Capstone project  =>

prompt engineering / python / api testing and framework 
========================================================
=>Playwright MCP => 
automation tool => UI and API testing  => 
========================================================
a. how we do test ai apps
