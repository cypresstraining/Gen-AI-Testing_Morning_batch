Thanks for joining with us !!!!!
Today we would like to understand 
1. Pre requisites to Learn Gen AI testing 

Differences between AI /Gen AI / Agentic AI in very high level. 

AI => Artificial intelligence  => it is thinking like a human => Machine with brain 
AI means machine learning algorithms will do predictive analysis based on the conditions you provided.
As  human AI scientist you can supply conditions to be considered while providing the predictive analysis.


Recent Past AI is buzzing !
========================================================
Gen AI  => An AI system which generate a new content based on the Customer query or question.
This content should be a text /Image / Code /Video format.
but this is a new creative idea developed by AI ( Gen AI).
Step by step process to complete the Task.
Example : If you ask a question to my genAI application  automate https://plywright.dev application home page. 
Answer : I can provide detailed step by step explanation to do this task.
========================================================
Agentic AI => An AI system which will complete the tasks by considering it can take decisions. That means kind of autonomous AI .

Example: If you ask a question to my Agentic AI agent  automate https://playwright.dev application home page.

Answer: it generate the code in your VScode and execute them . 
it is having the super power to complete the task by taking the decision.
========================================================

1. Manual testing or STLC ( software testing life cycle)

a. Requirement Analysis  => understand the customer requirement 
b. Able to write the test scenarios and test cases => execute them 
1. Test methodologies 
 Smoke testing 
 Sanity testing 
 Retesting
 Regression testing 
 Positive testing 
 Negative testing 
 Happy path
 Non happy path 
2. Test case design techniques 
   BVA
   ECP
   Decision table 
   Error guessing 
   State transitions 

3. Defect life cycle 

4. Agile process 
5. JIRA 

c. Identify the defects 
https://academybugs.com/find-bugs
========================================================
2. API testing => 

We need to understand basic of CRUD operations 

Request /Response 
Status code 
1XX
2XX
3XX
4XX
5XX
Postman tool if possible - similar tools 
to trouble shoot the problem  => 
Root cause analysis  => 
=======================================================
What we teach in the session or course 
=======================================================
3. Understand Frameworks or technologies involved in building AI applications ( Gen AI or Agentic AI) 
a. Lanchain 
b.Crew AI 
LLMS ( large language models )  

4. After building the application as a customer how do we use this application ?  that is matter for tester ! 

=> Prompt Engineering  => supply the prompt to solve your problem. 

This questioning is techniques is called as Prompting!
how many possible ways to ask a question to AI application. 
a. Single shot prompt 
b. few shots prompts 
c. Tricky prompt 
d. Funny prompts 
e. Jail breaking prompt 
f. Prompt leakage
g. prompt injection 
etc...
techniques we are using in the prompt engineering training.

5. We can take the help of core python and libraries to communicate with LLMS as a AI tester. 

LLMS speak with the tools or frame works -  Python programming language  => 

=> Loops 
=> Conditional statements 
-> Variables => 
=> operators kind of very basics 

Numpys  =>
Pandas  => 
========================================================
We are adding playwright with MCP (model context protocal )  to boost your Automation skills .
========================================================
AI powered Testing 
a. Gen AI /Agentic Product testing 
b. Automating testing with AI ( playwright) - 
MCP => which is easily connecting different tools
Any tools  => 
To complete the tasks AI brain requires some hands  => MCP
========================================================
